<h2 class="section">Education</h2>

	<h3>B.A. in Liberal Arts and Sciences</h3>
		<h4>University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 2004</h4>
			<h5>Double Major in English and Rhetoric</h5>


				<p>While enrolled, I was an Illinois State Scholar and Dean's List recipient who maintained a 3.5 major GPA and participated in an innovative research project under <a href="http://www.nancyabelmann.com/">Dr. Nancy Ablemann</a>, the <a href="http://www.eui.illinois.edu">Ethnography of the University</a> project.  I conducted instructor supervised, IRB approved research into the 2003 budget cuts at UIUC and my research and feedback on the project is <a href="http://www.eui.illinois.edu/archives_gallery.html">archived</a> and <a href="http://www.eui.illinois.edu/about_testimonials_s1.html">referenced</a> in pedagogical initiatives currently underway at the university.</p>

	<h3>M.A. in English and American Literature</h3>
		<h4>DePaul University, Chicago, 2008</h4>

				<p>I conducted research of technical detail in fiction (e.g. how authors create believability in fiction through the inclusion of technical detail), specifically how authors incorporated details of socioeconomic and class differences to engage period audiences in fiction and drama.  I graduated with distinction (3.95 GPA), accumulating an wide variety of experience in research throughout my program.</p>


	<h3>Ph.D. Candidate in Technical Communication</h3>
		<h4>Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, 2009-Present</h4>

				<p class="last">As a student, I am working on research into increasing technological proficiencies in the United States citizenry and advocating for an increase in awareness of the need to efficiently and persuasively communicate information to decision makers and laypersons with regard to public policy issues.  As a writing center tutor and an adjunct faculty member teaching in Humanities and English, I am working to improve the visibility and relevance of an education in the humanities at a technological university.</p>

<h2 class="section">Instructional Experience</h2>

	<h3>Humanities 106: Life Stories</h3>
		<h4>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2009, Spring 2010, Fall 2010</h4>
				
				<p>A course dedicated to the different genres of writing that tell individuals' stories.  The iterations of this course that I designed over the past three semesters have included readings from Benjamin Franklin, Harriet Jacobs, Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Martin Luther King Jr., Tim O'Brien, Dave Eggers, and David Sedaris.  In addition to introducing literature to freshman students, this course covered important philosophical and critical theory concepts that allowed students to engage texts critically.  Students were required to complete numerous written assignments, supported by peer workshops paired with out-of-class instructor feedback at all stages of the writing process.</p>

	<h3>Literature 309: Short Fiction</h3> 
		<h4>Illinois Institute of Technology: Spring 2010</h4>
				
				<p>This course featured selections of less frequently anthologized short fiction pieces, as well as a few classics.  The goal of the course is to introduce students to this genre, learn the fundamental tenets, explore how the genre has evolved since the late eighteenth century in the United States, and question why this genre is still relevant and an integral part of narratives and fiction that we consume today.  For their final projects, I encouraged students to go beyond writing a term paper and several students developed collages, photography portfolios, and websites/multimedia content to supplement their critical analyses.</p>

	<h3>Literature 380: Shakespeare: Print, Screen, and Stage</h3>
		<h4>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2010</h4>
				
				<p class="last">A literature class where students read Shakespeare and compared the text of his plays to film and stage performances.  Students performed close readings of the plays and examined contextual material to understand period concepts associated with Shakespeare's writing.  This course also included sections on the vocabulary and critical concepts necessary to analyze film and stage productions, with an emphasis on applying those concepts to both traditional and interpretive films and performances.</p>

<div id="tutor">

<h2 class="section">Tutoring Experience</h2>

	<h3>Writing Center Tutor</h3>
		<h4>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2009</h4>
				<p>As a writing center tutor at IIT, I adopted a directive approach in assisting students in their writing projects.  I assisted students primarily with projects relating to scientific reports and papers, art and architectural history, and professional development documents such as r&#233;sum&#233;s, CV's, and applications for graduate study.</p>

	<h3>Writing Consultant</h3>
		<h4>DePaul University: 2006-2008</h4>
				<p>My approach to tutoring writing at DePaul University rested on a balance between directive and non-directive strategies.  For instance, I advocated for and employed much more directive strategies for English as a Target Language (ETL) students as a result of my experiences collaborating with the English Language Academy.  As a consultant, I worked with hundreds of students from various disciplines.</p>

	<h3>Freelance Writing Consultant</h3>
		<h4>2008-Present</h4>
				<p class="last">In my work as a freelance writing consultant I have mainly worked with graduate students on completing degree requirement writings such as dissertation proposals, and in one case, an entire dissertation.  I also have experience working with academic professionals to improve their professional and business writing skills.</p>

<h2 class="section">Conferences and Publications</h2>

	<h3>The Impact of Emerging Literacies on Instant Messaging and Supplemental Writing Instruction</h3>
		<h4>Computers and Writing: 5/21/10, Purdue University</h4>
				
				<p>A mini-workshop where participants briefly simulated a writing center tutorial conducted through a web-based instant messaging application (Google Docs) in order to gain an understanding of the complexities of the literacy that has emerged from this media and how that literacy expands and reshapes writing instruction.</p>

	<h3>Open Source Tutoring: An examination of the Role of Service-Learning in the Writing Center</h3>
		<h4>Chicagoland Writing Center Association Conference: 2/6/10, DePaul University</h4>
				
				<p>In this piece I introduced a concept called "Open Source Tutoring," a method of tutoring that both disseminates knowledge amongst peer tutors and reveals the processes of writing to tutees, preparing both parties to engage in reflexive and informed writing practices while also demystifying supplemental writing instruction.  My findings were that community partner organizations are often forced to reduce the tutoring process to a brief encounter (e.g. students visit the writing center with a personal statement for fifteen minutes on a college visit day).  Using open source practices (i.e. teaching students how to replicate the experience of providing writing consultation with their peers) and open source technology (e.g. free and open applications for writing) along with long-term engagement strategies is a way to maximize the impact of supplemental writing instruction outside of the university community.</p>


	<h3>Community, Collaboration, Cogitation: The Three "C's" of Tutor Training</h3>
		<h4>Chicagoland Writing Center Association Conference: 2/7/2009, North Park University</h4>
				
				<p>A review of training methods employed for tutors at the DePaul University Center for Writing-based learning, including theoretical underpinnings for structured approaches to writing center administration, including structuring time for professional development, community building, formal/informal collaboration, and critical reflection on tutoring approaches.  Coauthored with Laura Friddle, Rickie-Ann Legleitner, and Alexis Maloof.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/magazine/articles/ss09Writing.asp">"The Decline of Writing?"</a></h3>
		<h4>DePaul Magazine: Spring/Summer 2009</h4>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/magazine/articles/ss09Writing.asp">An article</a> that critically examines and debunks the myth that technology somehow negatively impacts writing.  Technology in fact provides a multitude of opportunities to write that were not present in the past.  Please note that although the article appears in a "question and answer" format, the questions were added after the fact by the editor of the magazine as section headers; the authors did not "respond" to the questions in the article when writing the article.  Coauthored with Lauri Dietz and Alexis Maloof.</p>


	<h3><a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/~writing/html/pub/podcast.html">"Hot Topics In Writing" Podcast</a></h3> 
		<h4>University Center for Writing-based Learning: 2008-2009</h4>
				
				<p class="last"><a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/~writing/html/pub/podcast.html">A podcast</a> exploring issues in teaching and tutoring writing.  Episodes included interviews with faculty members at DePaul as well as topical segments related to student writing.  All episodes written, produced and recorded by myself, Alexis Maloof, and Julie Glasier.  Available on iTunes.</p>

<div id="professional">

<h2 class="section">Professional Experience</h2>

	<h3>Business Manager</h3>
		<h4>DePaul University Center for Writing-based Learning: August 2007- May 2009</h4>
			
			<p>I was responsible for tabulating statistics about student usage, evaluating employee performance, implementing new pedagogical procedures, and working with the director to ensure that the Writing Center operated efficiently and within budget by managing payroll hours for approximately 60 employees.  Additionally, I managed the UCWbL's web presence, including social media and a podcast.</p>

	<h3>Claims Adjuster, Independent Claims Adjuster</h3>
		<h4>National Claims Services: September 2005-August 2006</h4>
			
			<p class="last">I settled moving damage claims with the United States Armed Services ranging in value and size from under a hundred dollars to over $30,000.  In addition to settling claims, I made several appeals before the federal board regulating Military-Industrial claims settlements in cases where a dispute prevented settlement.  I was also recognized by the president of NCS for my efforts to use Excel to simplify complex liability calculations.  As a member of the claims department, I also provided customer service to men and women in the armed forces who had difficulty with their government-sponsored move.  After I left the company to return to graduate school, I remained as an outside consultant for two years.</p>
