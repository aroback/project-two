<h2>Humanities 106: Life Stories</h2>
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2009, Spring 2010, Fall 2010</h3>
				
				<p>A course dedicated to the different genres of writing that tell individuals' stories.  The iterations of this course that I designed over the past three semesters have included readings from Benjamin Franklin, Harriet Jacobs, Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Martin Luther King Jr., Tim O'Brien, Dave Eggers, and David Sedaris.  In addition to introducing literature to freshman students, this course covered important philosophical and critical theory concepts that allowed students to engage texts critically.  Students were required to complete numerous written assignments, supported by peer workshops paired with out-of-class instructor feedback at all stages of the writing process.</p>

	<h2>Literature 309: Short Fiction</h2> 
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Spring 2010</h3>
				
				<p>This course featured selections of less frequently anthologized short fiction pieces, as well as a few classics.  The goal of the course is to introduce students to this genre, learn the fundamental tenets, explore how the genre has evolved since the late eighteenth century in the United States, and question why this genre is still relevant and an integral part of narratives and fiction that we consume today.  For their final projects, I encouraged students to go beyond writing a term paper and several students developed collages, photography portfolios, and websites/multimedia content to supplement their critical analyses.</p>

	<h2>Literature 380: Shakespeare: Print, Screen, and Stage</h2>
		<h3>Illinois Institute of Technology: Fall 2010</h3>
				
				<p>A literature class where students read Shakespeare and compared the text of his plays to film and stage performances.  Students performed close readings of the plays and examined contextual material to understand period concepts associated with Shakespeare's writing.  This course also included sections on the vocabulary and critical concepts necessary to analyze film and stage productions, with an emphasis on applying those concepts to both traditional and interpretive films and performances.</p>
