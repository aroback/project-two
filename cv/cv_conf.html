	<h2>The Impact of Emerging Literacies on Instant Messaging and Supplemental Writing Instruction</h2>
		<h3>Computers and Writing: 5/21/10, Purdue University</h3>
				
				<p>A mini-workshop where participants briefly simulated a writing center tutorial conducted through a web-based instant messaging application (Google Docs) in order to gain an understanding of the complexities of the literacy that has emerged from this media and how that literacy expands and reshapes writing instruction.</p>

	<h2>Open Source Tutoring: An examination of the Role of Service-Learning in the Writing Center</h2>
		<h3>Chicagoland Writing Center Association Conference: 2/6/10, DePaul University</h3>
				
				<p>In this piece I introduced a concept called "Open Source Tutoring," a method of tutoring that both disseminates knowledge amongst peer tutors and reveals the processes of writing to tutees, preparing both parties to engage in reflexive and informed writing practices while also demystifying supplemental writing instruction.  My findings were that community partner organizations are often forced to reduce the tutoring process to a brief encounter (e.g. students visit the writing center with a personal statement for fifteen minutes on a college visit day).  Using open source practices (i.e. teaching students how to replicate the experience of providing writing consultation with their peers) and open source technology (e.g. free and open applications for writing) along with long-term engagement strategies is a way to maximize the impact of supplemental writing instruction outside of the university community.</p>


	<h2>Community, Collaboration, Cogitation: The Three "C's" of Tutor Training</h2>
		<h3>Chicagoland Writing Center Association Conference: 2/7/2009, North Park University</h3>
				
				<p>A review of training methods employed for tutors at the DePaul University Center for Writing-based learning, including theoretical underpinnings for structured approaches to writing center administration, including structuring time for professional development, community building, formal/informal collaboration, and critical reflection on tutoring approaches.  Coauthored with Laura Friddle, Rickie-Ann Legleitner, and Alexis Maloof.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/magazine/articles/ss09Writing.asp">"The Decline of Writing?"</a></h2>
		<h3>DePaul Magazine: Spring/Summer 2009</h3>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.depaul.edu/magazine/articles/ss09Writing.asp">An article</a> that critically examines and debunks the myth that technology somehow negatively impacts writing.  Technology in fact provides a multitude of opportunities to write that were not present in the past.  Please note that although the article appears in a "question and answer" format, the questions were added after the fact by the editor of the magazine as section headers; the authors did not "respond" to the questions in the article when writing the article.  Coauthored with Lauri Dietz and Alexis Maloof.</p>


	<h2><a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/~writing/html/pub/podcast.html">"Hot Topics In Writing" Podcast</a></h2>
		<h3>University Center for Writing-based Learning: 2008-2009</h3>
				
				<p><a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/~writing/html/pub/podcast.html">A podcast</a> exploring issues in teaching and tutoring writing.  Episodes included interviews with faculty members at DePaul as well as topical segments related to student writing.  All episodes written, produced and recorded by myself, Alexis Maloof, and Julie Glasier.  Available on iTunes.</p>
