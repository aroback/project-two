	<h2>Business Manager</h2>
		<h3>DePaul University Center for Writing-based Learning: August 2007- May 2009</h3>
			
			<p>I was responsible for tabulating statistics about student usage, evaluating employee performance, implementing new pedagogical procedures, and working with the director to ensure that the Writing Center operated efficiently and within budget by managing payroll hours for approximately 60 employees.  Additionally, I managed the UCWbL's web presence, including social media and a podcast.</p>

	<h2>Claims Adjuster, Independent Claims Adjuster</h2>
		<h3>National Claims Services: September 2005-August 2006</h3>
			
			<p>I settled moving damage claims with the United States Armed Services ranging in value and size from under a hundred dollars to over $30,000.  In addition to settling claims, I made several appeals before the federal board regulating Military-Industrial claims settlements in cases where a dispute prevented settlement.  I was also recognized by the president of NCS for my efforts to use Excel to simplify complex liability calculations.  As a member of the claims department, I also provided customer service to men and women in the armed forces who had difficulty with their government-sponsored move.  After I left the company to return to graduate school, I remained as an outside consultant for two years.</p>
