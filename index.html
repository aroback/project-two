	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://iit.edu">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> in the Technical Communication program and a predoctoral teaching fellow in the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/csl/hum/">Lewis Department of Humanities.</a>  My goal is to obtain a tenure-track appointment at a four year university.</p>
		
	<h2>This Site</h2>
		<p>This site is organized into four main sections.  My <a href="./cv/cv_home.html">Cirriculum Vitae</a> offers a summary of my education and work experience to date.  The <a href="./design/design.html">Design Projects</a> page contains projects that I have worked on as part of a document design course at IIT.  The <a href="./papers/papers.html">Select Papers</a> page offers some of my work in both technical communication, as well as literature studies.  Finally, <a href="./projects/projects.html">Other Projects</a> links to some external sites that contain projects I have participated in.</p>
	
	<h2>Feedback</h2>
		<p>This site is under construction as part of my coursework for <a href="http://courses.karlstolley.com/530/CourseHome">COM 530: Standards-based Web Design</a>.  This site is designed as a standards-compliant exercise in writing for the web.  Please feel free to offer your feedback (my contact information can be found on the <a href="./about/about.html">About Me</a> page).</p>
