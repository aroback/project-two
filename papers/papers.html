<h2>The Changing Face of Public Policy Studies in Technical Communication</h2>
	<p>The last decade has seen a great deal of interest in public policy studies within the field of technical communication. Recent political events and technological advancements have made public policy debate more accessible and commonplace. This paper categorizes and synthesizes some past approaches to analysis of public policy discourse, explores pedagogical directions for integrating public policy studies into curricula, and suggests areas of future exploration such as the study of the role of social media and e-Government in public policy discourse.</p>
