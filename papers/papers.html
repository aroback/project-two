<h2>The Changing Face of Public Policy Studies in Technical Communication</h2>
	<p>The last decade has seen a great deal of interest in public policy studies within the field of technical communication. Recent political events and technological advancements have made public policy debate more accessible and commonplace. This paper categorizes and synthesizes some past approaches to analysis of public policy discourse, explores pedagogical directions for integrating public policy studies into curricula, and suggests areas of future exploration such as the study of the role of social media and e-Government in public policy discourse.</p>

<h2>The Effect of Detailed Instructions and Composition Format on Relative Uniqueness in User Generated Public Policy Correspondence</h2>
	<p>Many non-profit and advocacy websites contain form letters advocating a position on a topic of public policy debate that they wish users to personalize and send to government officials. While the uniqueness of user generated content is questionable when writing to elected legislators, it is necessary when commenting on proposed regulations in the realm of e-rulemaking, a publicly accessible forum. The proposed study seeks to test whether a detailed definition of the word “personalize” will lead to greater uniqueness of user generated written products, while also examining whether different formats for composing correspondence result in different levels of uniqueness in the final, written products.</p>

<h2>User Behaviors, Attitudes, and Information Structure: Towards a Model for Developing an Effective Enterprise Social Media Site</h2>
	<p>Social media sites have exploded in popularity in recent years, leading researchers to develop usage models to explain user behaviors and account for the ways in which people utilize these sites. Simultaneously, the ubiquity of these sites and their popularity with persons in the 21-30 age bracket as well as with teens and college students has led employers to explore ways that they can utilize social media and web collaboration to reach out to potential employees and increase employee productivity, company efficiency, and employee satisfaction. This paper discusses some of the previous models suggested for user behavior on SNS's and proposes a research approach that uses qualitative research methods (including participatory design) to explore how information is structured to maximize participation in volutary, enterprise SNS's.</p>

<h2>Accumulation and Control in <cite>Fanny Hill</cite>: Fanny's Role in The Emergent Middle-Class Society of Eighteenth Century England</h2>
	<p>This paper carefully scrutinizes the financial transactions in John Cleland's novel <cite>Fanny Hill</cite> and makes comparisons to conceptions of the middle-class in 18th century England.  Fanny, an ambitious prostitute with dreams of upward class mobility, displays the tendencies of an entrepreneur and Cleland fashions her off of the emergent merchant and professional classes, a stylistic choice that makes the novel more fantasy than a realistic depiction of life for an 18th century prostitute.</p>

<h2>Dante's use of Augustinian Rhetoric as a Tool for Instruction as Well as Persuasion Within the <cite>Pugatorio</cite></h2>
	<p>While there are many distinct sections to <cite>The Divine Comedy</cite>, a division of particular interest is the portion of the narrative which takes place on earth where Virgil is the consummate guide for Dante the Pilgrim, and the celestial phase of the comedy where Beatrice (and ultimately St. Bernard) lead Dante through the divine realm and a series of visions that defy mortal reason. The language, style, and Dante's interaction with his guide are different in each section, making the journey into two distinct portions with different authorial motivations for each. While both Inferno and Purgatorio take place within the earthly realm, the mountain of Purgatory is striking in that no prior detailed literary representation has been created which bestows upon Dante the privilege and burden of portraying a detailed and convincing purgatory. In order to make his representation of purgatory believable, Dante must draw on the existing literary conventions of the time and employ them in such a way as to not merely instruct his readers on matters of purgation, but to persuade them to alter their behavior and follow the Christian model of life; Dante does this through the use of rhetoric.</p>

<h2>Arden the Aristocrat: Tensions Between Feudal and Capitalist Models in <cite>Arden of Faversham</cite></h2>
	<p><cite>Arden of Faversham</cite> (1592) was written at a time when tensions existed between a communal lifestyle (feudalism) and an individualistic model of property control and accumulation (capitalism).  Those tensions are represented in the play throught the actions of the main character, Arden, who serves a both a landlord and a hapless murder victim.</p>
